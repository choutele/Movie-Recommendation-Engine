# Movie-Recommendation-Engine
Because of the growth in research and development humans in this era are likely to have more options and facilities as compared to a decade before. 
The time is such where humans have so many options for things that they are unable to decide what they really want. 
That's where machine generated algorithm and recommended systems came into picture. 
Well, when it comes to shopping online with brands such as Zara or H&M or buying shoes from Adidas or Nike there are so many options available that it can be difficult for an individual to choose what they want, and they end up getting confused. 
Same confusion builds up more when an individual listen to music on Spotify or watch movies on Netflix. 
Recommended system is a system that attempts to predict preferences of the user by learning from the user’s behavior.  
This report is an overview of movie lens data where we are suggesting a recommended system by analyzing ratings given by the users. 
Recommended system is an information filtering tool that is predominant when it comes to machine learning using big data technologies.  
The goal is to analyze the movies that are highly rated by the user’s and recommend them movies which are of similar ratings. 
Techniques such as Alternating Least Squares [ALS] for collaborative filtering, Regression Evaluator, spark SQL are used in the implementation of recommendation system. 
The Programming is done using PySpark with Hadoop Distributed File System [HDFS] as our storage model.  
The project's goal is to improve the customer experience by making tailored suggestions based on earlier user input.
